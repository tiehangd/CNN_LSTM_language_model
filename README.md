# CNN_LSTM_language_model
Implementation from scratch of a CNN-LSTM network for language models. Useful features are extracted from the CNN layer below and then feed up to the LSTM layer which forms a sequential context for the prediction.

To run the model, execute main_cnn_lstm.m, and feel free to tune the hyper parameters to see how the performance varies accordingly.
